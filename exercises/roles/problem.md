There are no hard and fast rules for naming your action pattern,
however, there are some conventions that help to organize them.

Indeed, a plugin:
- Provides a functionality to the system
- This functionality fulfills a role in the system

So it makes sense to use the form role:plugin-name as part of your action pattern. This creates a pattern namespace to avoid clashes with other plugin patterns. The use of the word “role” also indicates that other plugins may override some aspects of this role (that is, aspects of this functionality) by providing extensions to some of the action patterns (we'll see how to extend microservices in the next exercise).

Another common convention is to use the property “cmd” for the main public commands exposed by the plugin. So, you might have, for example:

```
var plugin = function (options) {
  this.add( {role:'greetings', cmd:'hey'}, function( args, done ) {
    var hey = "Hey " + msg.name;
    respond( null, { answer: hey });
  })
}
```

The goal of the exercise is to add to the `math` module from the previous
exercise a new command `product` with the same role `math`. This command will
multiply two numbers.

When you have completed your program, you can run it in the test environment with:

  {bold}{appname} run program.js{/bold}

And once you are happy that it is correct then run:

  {bold}{appname} verify program.js{/bold}

And your submission will be verified for correctness. After you have
a correct solution, run `{bold}{appname}{/bold}` again and select the next problem!
