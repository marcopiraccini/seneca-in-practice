Patterns make it easy for you to extend your functionality. Instead of adding if statements and complex logic
, you simply add more patterns.

So for instance, thinking about hello example, we could extend the service to support the italian language. 
To do this, we can add a new property, lang:it, to the message object. Then, we provide a new action for messages that have this property:

```javascript
var seneca = require('seneca')()

seneca.add( 'role:greetings, cmd:hello', function( msg, respond ) {
    var hello = "Hello " + msg.name;
    respond( null, { answer: hello });
});

seneca.add( 'role:greetings, cmd:hello, lang:it', function( msg, respond ) {
    var hello = "Ciao " + msg.name;
    respond( null, { answer: hello });
});

```

Now, this message:

```javascript
{role: 'greetings', cmd: 'hello', name: 'Michele', lang: 'it'}

```

will produce:

```javascript
{answer: 'Ciao Michele'}

```

The goal of the exercise is to extend the sum plugin so that it supports the ability to force integer-only arithmetic.
To do this, you add a new property, integer:true, to the message object and then apply Math.floor to both numbers.

When you have completed your program, you can run it in the test environment with:

  {bold}{appname} run program.js{/bold}

And once you are happy that it is correct then run:

  {bold}{appname} verify program.js{/bold}

And your submission will be verified for correctness. After you have
a correct solution, run `{bold}{appname}{/bold}` again and select the next problem!
